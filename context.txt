# Flutter Bluetooth Car Controller - Current Issues

## Project Context
This is a Flutter Bluetooth car controller app designed to control an Arduino-based car via HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth modules. The app sends specific commands (F/B/L/R for basic movement, G/H/I/J for diagonal movement) based on button presses and multitouch gestures.

## Build System Status ‚úÖ WORKING
- Build script (`./build_script.sh android`) works perfectly
- Auto-detects APK location and creates versioned files (bt_controller_v1.apk, v2.apk, etc.)
- Current version: v6 (41MB, optimized from original 55MB)
- No manual copying needed anymore

## Current UI Problems üö® STILL BROKEN

### Problem 1: Special Buttons Still Show Icons
**Expected**: C, S, Z buttons should show ONLY the letters C, S, Z (no icons)
**Current Reality**: The buttons still display icons (tune icon on C, stop icon on S, center focus icon on Z)
**User's Request**: "don't keep any other symbol other than the C,S and Z for those special buttons"

**Code Changes Made (But Not Working)**:
```dart
// In control_button_widget.dart - line 56
child: (command == ControlCommand.calibrate || command == ControlCommand.stop || command == ControlCommand.resetAngle)
  ? Center(
      child: Text(
        command.command,  // Should show just "C", "S", "Z"
        style: TextStyle(
          color: _getIconColor(color),
          fontSize: size * 0.4,
          fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
        ),
      ),
    )
  : Column(/* with icons for movement buttons */)
```

### Problem 2: L/R Buttons Still Arranged Vertically
**Expected**: L and R buttons should be side by side horizontally in the same row
**Current Reality**: L and R buttons are still stacked vertically (one above the other)
**User's Request**: "keep the L and R button side by side in the same row, don't keep them one under the other"

**Code Changes Made (But Not Working)**:
```dart
// In control_grid_widget.dart - line 213
// Right side: Left and Right buttons in horizontal row
Row(
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: [
    ControlButtonWidget(command: ControlCommand.left, size: 100, ...),
    const SizedBox(width: 16),
    ControlButtonWidget(command: ControlCommand.right, size: 100, ...),
  ],
),
```

## What Has Been Attempted
1. **Multiple clean builds**: `flutter clean && ./build_script.sh android`
2. **Direct condition checks**: Replaced helper method with inline conditions
3. **Layout restructuring**: Changed from Column to Row for L/R buttons
4. **Version increments**: Built v3, v4, v5, v6 with supposed fixes

## Target Layout (What User Wants)
```
   [C]      [S]      [Z]     ‚Üê Text only, no icons
   
[F]      üöó        [L] [R]   ‚Üê F/B vertical, L/R horizontal  
[B]    Status
```

## Current Layout (What's Actually Showing)
```
   [üéµC]    [‚èπS]    [üéØZ]   ‚Üê Still has icons!
   
[F]      üöó        [L]      ‚Üê L/R still vertical!
[B]    Status      [R]
```

## Button Functionality ‚úÖ WORKING
- Multitouch diagonal movements work correctly (F+L=G, F+R=I, B+L=H, B+R=J)
- Press/release behavior works (command on press, 'S' on release)
- Button color states work (dark‚Üíblue for movement, orange‚Üíwhite for special)
- Bluetooth integration is ready

## Size Requirements ‚úÖ PARTIALLY MET
- Current: 41MB (reduced from 55MB)
- Target: ~20MB (would require removing core Flutter components)
- Movement buttons: 100px (25% larger than original 80px) ‚úÖ

## Technical Details
- Flutter 3.32.8
- Dart 3.8.1
- Target: Android API 35
- Architecture: ARM64-only for size optimization
- Dependencies: flutter_blue_plus, permission_handler, provider

## Suspected Issues
1. **Hot reload not working**: Changes might not be applied despite clean builds
2. **Conditional logic failure**: The special button detection might not be working
3. **Layout priority**: Row layout might be overridden by parent constraints
4. **Build cache**: Some cached components might not be updating

## Next Steps Needed
1. Debug why the conditional logic for special buttons isn't working
2. Investigate why Row layout for L/R buttons isn't being applied
3. Possibly need to examine the actual widget tree during runtime
4. Consider completely rewriting the problematic components from scratch
